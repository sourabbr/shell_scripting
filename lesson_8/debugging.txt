Debugging:

-x = Show execution of each line
-e = Exit on error
Can be combined with other options.
Eg: #!/bin/bash -ex , #!/bin/bash -xe , #!/bin/bash -e -x , #!/bin/bash -x -e
The other does not matters

-v = Prints shell input lines as they are read.

To more debugging options:
help set | less


You can change the output of debugging by changing the "PS4" variable
