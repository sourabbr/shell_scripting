Logging:

In linux for logging we can use Syslog.
The syslog standard uses facilities and severities to categorize messages.
Facilities: kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, local0, local7
Severities: emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug

Log file locations are configurable:
/var/log/messages
/var/log/syslog
